    `The rest is empty with no brain, but the clever nerd
The best emcee with no chain, ya ever heard`,

    `Forgot about the cack-a-lack, holla back; clack-clack, blocka
Villainy, feel him in ya heart chakra, chart-toppa
Start-shit stoppa, be a smart shoppa
Shot-a-Cop day around the way 'bout to stay
But who'd a know there's two mo' that wonder where the shooter go`,

    `On the night I was born, the rain was pourin', God was cryin'
Lightnin' struck, power outage, sparks was flyin'
The real one's here, the young boy that walk with lions
Around the outlines of chalk where the corpses lyin'
Of course I'm tryin' to revive a sport that's dyin'
But the guns and the drug bars that y'all rely on
Got these nerds thinkin' that you niggas hard as I am
But that just mean I ain't as comfortable as y'all with lyin'
Stretchin' the truth, know I never stress in the booth
They feel the pressure, me I feel like I just left the masseuse
Effortless, how I'm skatin' on these records is proof
I put your favorite rapper neck in a noose, never lettin' them loose
Cole World, the heat'll blast through your speaker
He the last of Mohicans, no weaklings last in my sneakers
Nigga want me on a song, he gon' see the wrath of the reaper
I'm prolly gon' go to Hell if Jesus ask for a feature
I'm higher than niggas and don't need a bag full of reefer
Some see the glass as empty, I see a glass full of ether
Collectin' his bread en masse like he a Catholic preacher
Just to count a nigga cash, you might need a calculus teacher
Eureka, Einstein on the brink of the theory of relativity
Really, no MC equal, feel me?
Cole pen be lethal, crib like an old MTV show, uh
On God, the best rapper alive
Headshot, now go and ask the best rappers that died`,

    `Paint cold pictures like Nova Scotia landscapes
Nerd gang, make Mandelbrot sets when we handshake
A word game back up plan that can dam lakes
Backup the word-play ain't playing that the man's states
Means I can still be the man if the dam breaks
And when demand brakes I'm reflectious, what they can't face
My peers will still treat the mirror like it's a fan base
The unfettered veteran, the eagle feathered man of medicine
That hovers above cities like weathermen`,

    `I got the shit you could light with a lighter
Fuck a lighter, I could light on the stove
Dark at night, I'll drop a log on the fire
Wander in the woods out in the cold
I got the shit you could play for your mama
I got the shit you could play for the hoes
I got the shit you could sell to the trappers
In Decatur with the K and the Colt
I know some rappers thatâ€”how I'ma say this?
I know some rappers who paid but broke
Lotta money but you played your soul
You played yourself, you played the role
I got some niggas who down the street
Some of my niggas been down the road
Lost a nigga that was down with me
You know what they say, it rains, it pours`,

    `Sometimes I wake up, up in the morning, make her
Wipe the smudge of make-up off my bed, soon as she's yawnin', take up
Hours upon days just to find power shit to say
But you won't hear it even if your ears was pierced with Beats by Dre, I mean
The sun is slowly fallin', we all surely should die eventually
So what's your calling? Oh, you left your phone behind?
Identity crisis, break mirrors, vices steer us through wickedness
Jesus Christ is right near us, and Devil said you owe ten percent
Sold your soul, I know, sold your soul and you're hopeless
My focus, stare at elopin' on boats that float in the open of oceans
That coast the line on the margins I rhyme, you chokin' or soakin' up game
I'm hopin' you picked the second one, shame
The emotion of jealousy that you're holdin', you're tellin' me
That you're golden but really cubic zirconia, let me see
I'll break you down like a pound of fire, whenever
Your tactics are mighty clever but even if you're Mayweather you`
