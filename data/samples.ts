    `The rest is empty with no brain, but the clever nerd
The best emcee with no chain, ya ever heard`,

    `Forgot about the cack-a-lack, holla back; clack-clack, blocka
Villainy, feel him in ya heart chakra, chart-toppa
Start-shit stoppa, be a smart shoppa
Shot-a-Cop day around the way 'bout to stay
But who'd a know there's two mo' that wonder where the shooter go`,

    `On the night I was born, the rain was pourin', God was cryin'
Lightnin' struck, power outage, sparks was flyin'
The real one's here, the young boy that walk with lions
Around the outlines of chalk where the corpses lyin'
Of course I'm tryin' to revive a sport that's dyin'
But the guns and the drug bars that y'all rely on
Got these nerds thinkin' that you niggas hard as I am
But that just mean I ain't as comfortable as y'all with lyin'
Stretchin' the truth, know I never stress in the booth
They feel the pressure, me I feel like I just left the masseuse
Effortless, how I'm skatin' on these records is proof
I put your favorite rapper neck in a noose, never lettin' them loose
Cole World, the heat'll blast through your speaker
He the last of Mohicans, no weaklings last in my sneakers
Nigga want me on a song, he gon' see the wrath of the reaper
I'm prolly gon' go to Hell if Jesus ask for a feature
I'm higher than niggas and don't need a bag full of reefer
Some see the glass as empty, I see a glass full of ether
Collectin' his bread en masse like he a Catholic preacher
Just to count a nigga cash, you might need a calculus teacher
Eureka, Einstein on the brink of the theory of relativity
Really, no MC equal, feel me?
Cole pen be lethal, crib like an old MTV show, uh
On God, the best rapper alive
Headshot, now go and ask the best rappers that died`,

    `Paint cold pictures like Nova Scotia landscapes
Nerd gang, make Mandelbrot sets when we handshake
A word game back up plan that can dam lakes
Backup the word-play ain't playing that the man's states
Means I can still be the man if the dam breaks
And when demand brakes I'm reflectious, what they can't face
My peers will still treat the mirror like it's a fan base
The unfettered veteran, the eagle feathered man of medicine
That hovers above cities like weathermen`,

    `I got the shit you could light with a lighter
Fuck a lighter, I could light on the stove
Dark at night, I'll drop a log on the fire
Wander in the woods out in the cold
I got the shit you could play for your mama
I got the shit you could play for the hoes
I got the shit you could sell to the trappers
In Decatur with the Kay and the Colt
I know some rappers that—how I'ma say this?
I know some rappers who paid but broke
Lotta money but you played your soul
You played yourself, you played the role
I got some niggas who down the street
Some of my niggas been down the road
Lost a nigga that was down with me
You know what they say, it rains, it pours`,

    `Sometimes I wake up, up in the morning, make her
Wipe the smudge of make-up off my bed, soon as she's yawning, take up
Hours upon days just to find power shit to say
But you won't hear it even if your ears was pierced with Beats by Dre, I mean
The sun is slowly falling, we all surely should die eventually
So what's your calling? Oh, you left your phone behind?
Identity crisis, break mirrors, vices steer us through wickedness
Jesus Christ is right near us, and Devil said you owe ten percent
Sold yo' soul, I know, sold yo' soul and yo' hopeless
My focus, stare at elopin' on boats that float in the open of oceans
That coast the line on the margins I rhyme, you chokin' or soakin' up game
I'm hopin' you picked the second one, shame
The emotion of jealousy that you're holdin', you're tellin' me
That you're golden but really cubic zirconia, let me see
I'll break you down like a pound of fire, whenever
Your tactics are mighty clever but even if you're Mayweather you`,

    `This how it is when you in the Matrix
Dodging bullets, reaping what you sow
And stacking up the footage, living on the go
And sleeping in a villa
Sipping from a Grammy, walking in the building
Diamond in the ceiling, marble on the floors
Beach inside the window, peeking out the window
Baby in the pool, godfather goals
Only Lord knows I've been going hammer
Dodging paparazzi, freaking through the cameras
Eat at Four Daughters, Brock wearing sandals
Yoga on a Monday, stretching to Nirvana
Watching all the snakes, curving all the fakes
Phone never on, I don't conversate
I don't compromise, I just penetrate
Sex, money, murder, these are the breaks
These are the times, level number nine
Look up in the sky, ten is on the way
Sentence on the way, killings on the way
Motherfucker, I got winners on the way
You ain't shit without a body on your belt
You ain't shit without a ticket on your plate
You ain't sick enough to pull it on yourself
You ain't rich enough to hit the lot and skate
Tell me when destruction gonna be my fate
Gonna be your fate, gonna be our faith
Peace to the world, let it rotate
Sex, money, murder, our DNA`,

    `Rappers I monkey flip 'em with the funky rhythm, I be kickin'
Musician, inflictin' composition of pain
I'm like Scarface sniffin' cocaine
Holdin' an M-sixteen, see, with the pen I'm extreme
Now, bullet holes left in my peep holes
I'm suited up with street clothes, hand me a .9 and I'll defeat foes
Y'all know my steelo, with or without the airplay
I keep some E&J, sitting bent up in the stairway
Or either on the corner betting Grants with the cee-lo champs
Laughin at base-heads, tryna sell some broken amps
G-packs get off quick, forever niggas talk shit
Reminiscin' about the last time the task force flipped
Niggas be runnin' through the block shootin'
Time to start the revolution, catch a body, head for Houston
Once they caught us off-guard, the MAC-ten was in the grass, and
I ran like a cheetah, with thoughts of an assassin
Picked the MAC up, told brothers "Back up!" — the MAC spit
Lead was hittin' niggas, one ran, I made him back-flip
Heard a few chicks scream, my arm shook, couldn't look
Gave another squeeze, heard it click, "Yo, my shit is stuck!"
Tried to cock it, it wouldn't shoot, now I'm in danger
Finally pulled it back and saw three bullets caught up in the chamber`,

    `It's funny how Zulu and Xhosa might go to war
Two tribal armies that wanna build and destroy
Remind me of these Compton Crip gangs that live next door
Beefing with Pirus, only death settle the score
So don't matter how much I say I like to preach with the Panthers
Or tell Georgia State "Marcus Garvey got all the answers"
Or try to celebrate February like it's my Bee-Day
Or eat watermelon, chicken, and Kool-Aid on weekdays
Or jump high enough to get Michael Jordan endorsements
Or watch B.E.T 'cause urban support is important
So why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the street
When gang-banging make me kill a nigga blacker than me?
Hypocrite!`,

    `Metasota warned me they wanna war
But actually they forfeiting
Like they wardrobe for half of the week
Still eating rappers like chicken quesadillas
With extra cheese and pico de gallo
Thinking they fire but they easily mild
Check the score, you're just a tourist
You ain't really wild
Ay, I made a hundred thousand then freaked it like a black and mild
Made another hundred thousand, then I blew it
Like a performance from Miles with a horn in his mouth
I do it, I was born with this style, it's unfortunate how
They put a pro-choice in question like abortion is now`,

    `High-rises built just like Section eight, you trapped up there
Purging all this foo shit, know that you can smell the sage, you step in here
Bagging up the Echinacea, what's the tea on me? He too low-key, I'm sellin' lemonade
I stay out the way, it's niggas in the way, swear, they not in the way
And would feel a way if I mentioned names, this shit is strange
These niggas facts be opinion based, but not in your face
Shifting shapes when they in your space, I'm a square reader
A small circle and we ain't adding a hare, neither
We all tortoise, came out of my shell, niggas not here for the fair weather
Ain't under no spell, I know you smell what a nigga cooking, I'm hungry as hell
These niggas gon' bear witness a Michelin star, could see it this far
Back when a nigga was line cookin', I'm sous chefin' these days
Proof-readin' these plates with a fine-tooth comb, won't find a line crooked
Still castin' lines, now I'm hookin' big fish out these waves
Yeah, still remember when it was minimum wage, yeah
Remember niggas went through their parts, no complaints
Now the art get contaminated and hearts full of shade, tend not to harp on the hate
Ayy, speakers knock but I didn't get in by my lonely
Lighters up, I gotta burn one for the homies that forever stayed down`
